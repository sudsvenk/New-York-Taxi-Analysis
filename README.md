# Predicting Average Cab Fare in New York

**Objective**: The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the average amount of money that people spend on cab rides in a certain region of New York at a given time of day.

**Methodology**: To accomplish this goal, we will gather data on past cab rides in New York, including the location, time of day, and fare paid. We will then use this data to train and test a machine learning model that can predict the average fare for a cab ride in a given region at a given time of day.

**Expected Results**: We expect that our machine learning model will be able to accurately predict the average fare for a cab ride in a given region at a given time of day, based on the data we have collected. This will allow us to provide more accurate estimates of cab fares to potential riders, and may also be useful for cab companies in pricing their services.

**Potential Applications**: The ability to accurately predict cab fares could be useful for a variety of stakeholders, including cab companies, riders, and transportation planners. By providing more accurate fare estimates, we can help cab companies to price their services more effectively and riders to better plan their transportation needs.
